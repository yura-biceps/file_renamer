# File Renamer Python Project

## 🎯 Goal  
Automate renaming of files in a folder with a consistent naming format.

## 🛠️ Task  
You have a folder full of files like:  
`report_1.pdf`, `data(3).xlsx`, `scan_final_2024.csv`

Write a script to:
- Rename them all to the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_<custom_tag>.<ext>`
- Let the user specify the custom tag (like `"shiftA"` or `"inspection"`)

## 🌟 Bonus  
- Add logging so you know what got renamed
